# PyBer_Analysis
Visualizing Ride-Sharing Data using Python and Pandas with Matplotlib in Jupyter Notebook

## Resources:
- Python 3.7.10 
- Anaconda 
- Pandas
- Matplotlib.pyplot 
- Jupyter Notebook

## Overview
- In this project we performed an exploratory analysis of Pyber ride sharing data in order to gain any insights into ridership and fare metrics by the types of cities in which Pyber operates. The goal for this analysis is to utilize insights from the ride sharing data to identify any potential correlation between a specific market type and total ride/fare revenue generated in the respective markets. In order to better illustrate the correlation between these key metrics we created visualizations that show the variance in performance by city type: rural, suburban, urban;  which can also be utilized by the executive team to improve access to ride-sharing and determine affordability in underserved areas. 

## Results
- Once we cleaned and merged the data together, we were able to identify some key insights that reaffirm baseline expectations for ride-sharing. The further you get from city centers the less accessible ride-sharing services become. The analysis results indicate that rural cities had the lowest number of rides, totalling **125 rides**; Suburban cities had more rides than urban areas with **625 rides**; and Urban cities had the highest ride volume with **1,625 rides**. The data also suggests that the costs of ride-sharing increases as the distance from the city center increases, which also impacts the number of Total Riders per city type and its accessibility as only **78 people used ride-sharing services in Rural areas as compared to Urban areas with a total of 2,405.** The results of the analysis can be referenced in the table below:
