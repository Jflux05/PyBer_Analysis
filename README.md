# PyBer_Analysis
Visualizing Ride-Sharing Data using Python and Pandas with Matplotlib in Jupyter Notebook

## Resources:
- Python 3.7.10 
- Anaconda 
- Pandas
- Matplotlib.pyplot 
- Jupyter Notebook

## Overview
In this project we performed an exploratory analysis of Pyber ride sharing data in order to gain any insights into ridership and fare metrics by the types of cities in which Pyber operates. The goal for this analysis is to utilize insights from the ride sharing data to identify any potential correlation between a specific market type and total ride/fare revenue generated in the respective markets. In order to better illustrate the correlation between these key metrics we created visualizations that show the variance in performance by city type: rural, suburban, urban;  which can also be utilized by the executive team to improve access to ride-sharing and determine affordability in underserved areas.
